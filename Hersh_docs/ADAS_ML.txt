From MIT:
-	DeepTraffic (model to know when to switch lanes on a highway for highest speed): http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/
	-	Very good pretrained model for DeepTraffic: https://github.com/parilo/DeepTraffic-solution
-	DeepTesla (model to detect steering angle of wheel from video of car lanes): http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptesla/

From Udacity:
-	Challenge 2: using deep learning to predict steering angles
